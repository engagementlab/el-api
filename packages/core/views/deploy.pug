                | This action will copy the content from the current QA build of 
                strong #{apps[schema].name} 
                | to production. Before doing this, please ensure the QA build is free of all content issues and any bugs that may be caused by missing or poor-quality content (e.g. images). This action is not easily reversible, and all content from QA will generally be immediately viewable by all users.
